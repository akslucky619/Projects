Nodeâ€™s module system makes use of a global function called require and a global object called module.exports. The two make for a straightforward module system.

Nodes module system creates a dependency tree, which tells node which file are needed to run the application.

Module.exports is used to export functions, objects, variables to other files which will use require global in order to use them.
