		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>The template includes the following:
		• Character and paragraph styles designed specifically for one-column proceedings
		publications
		• Buttons that automate some commonly used tasks.
		The margins and styles should remain constant for whatever version of Word you are using and
		whether you are using a Windows or Macintosh computer. But, please note that the buttons use
		Macros that will work only in Word ‘97 and subsequent versions.</p>
		<h1>Artwork</h1>
		<p>• You MUST include images (including photos) at 300 dpi or better; failure to do so will
		result in blurred images when printed; even if images are not scanned (i.e., they are already
		in electronic format), they still must be set to at least 300 dpi for good reproduction.
		• Images prepared for the web are typically set at 72 dpi and make for a very poor product;
		avoid using images from web-based material.
		• Make sure all type in graphs and figures is large enough to read and understand.
		• The readability of your paper in the finished publication is dependent on you providing
		good quality material.</p>

		<h1>Color</h1>
		<p>Color in a paper is acceptable, but if the publication will be in a print volume, all material will be
		printed in black and white. It is best to:
		• Avoid light colors such as yellow, light blue, light green and pink.
		• Delineation between plots in a graph should be indicated by type of symbol and/or line
		pattern; avoid color graphs where delineation between plots is indicated by color alone.</p>
